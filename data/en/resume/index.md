I'm a passionate python developer with over a decade of experience in web development. I'm especially strong in back-end development, good in automation and deployment (including CI/CD). Occasionally, I can do modern front-end.

I love simplicity, so I usually try to simplify things.

### In my spare time, I enjoy working on my open source projects, pursuing perfection, learning, experimenting:
- [Mailur][mailur] -- lightweight webmail inspired by Gmail
- [Timefor][gh-timefor] -- a command-line time tracker (Golang)
- more projects on [github page.][gh-naspeh]

### Technologies I've been actively using:
 - Python since Oct 2009;
 - PostgreSQL and Redis since Mar 2012;
 - Git since Dec 2009;
 - Linux since Jul 2008;
 - Containers since Aug 2014 ([podman], docker, [lxc], [systemd-nspawn]);
 - Bash, JavaScript, CSS/HTML periodically for many years.
